   * Fix serious bug where pisg would end up in an endless loop when multiple

     sorted correctly.
   * 'wordlength' was applying to nicks in 'most referenced nicks' as well,

   * Lines with only a single smiley, eg. '<user> :P' got counted as a
     UPPERCASE line, now ignored.

pisg (0.29) - Sat, Nov 10th 2001
   * When using multiple channels, and not all channels have user pics, it was
     showing a big empty coloumn with no userpics. Now it checks whether any
     users in top xx has a userpic, and if yes, add the coloumn.
   * Additionaly, users can force pictures of a channel with the new
     'userpics="n"' option. (This could be useful if a nick appears on many
     channels, but you only want the userpics on one..)
   * New version of addalias.pl by deadlock <deadlock@cheeseheadz.net>:
       - Doesn't need addalias.htm anymore, addalias.pl takes care of everything
       - Can dynamically change user data when a nick is already added in the
         config file
       - Improved error handling
       - Improved code

     the top 25.
   * New options:
     - 'show_activetimes' enable/disable 'Most Active Times' section.
     - 'show_bignumbers' enable/disable 'Big Numbers' and 'Other Interesting
       Numbers' section.

     'rankc' color option, it now does, and additionally adds a color
     'hi_rankc' for highlighted ranks.

     'latest topics' - fixed.
   * Hopefully fix pisg on Win32.
   * Add charset to the HTML page to make validator.w3.org happy, it's user
     defineable with the new 'charset' option, default is 'iso-8859-1'.
   * The color of the links in the bottom of the page (not in tables) can be
     set by the new 'bg_link', 'bg_hlink' and 'bg_vlink' options.
   * New option: 'default_pic' makes it possible to display a default picture
     for a user if no picture defined. For example to display a picture

   * New options by Patrick Aussems:
     - show_mrn, disable/enable most referenced nicks

   * Don't go beserk when the logfile doesn't contain any data; just tell it
     to the user.
   * Fix: Don't show empty quotes on the stats page.
   * More work on the object oriented goal of pisg:
      - cleanups, don't use globals in modules, define these in the object.
      - add HTMLGenerator.pm, and move all HTML generation code from pisg.pl
        to this new module.
      - New module Pisg.pm brings the rest of the main code into it's own
        module, this means that Pisg is no longer dependent of pisg.pl.

        Again, please report back if you find any trouble with any of these
        changes.

   * Better logic when no channels are defined. Instead of just defaulting to
     #channel and channel.log, then force the user to define these on either
     commandline or in the config file. This should be better for first-time
     users.
   * Ship developer docs in docs/dev/ instead of just dumping it in docs/,
     docs/ should be for end users.
   * Various updates to language templates

pisg (0.22) - Sat, Sep 15th 2001

     right order (thanks, Sascha Lüdecke)
   * A bunch of English grammar corrections (thanks, Phil Gregory)
   * Words like //www is now being ignored as they should.
   * Instead of 'slaps' we now have 'violence', so one can define their own
     action lines to be counted. Like '/me hits nick on the forehead',
     configured by the 'violent' variable.
   * pisg is undergoing a large change of it's code structure, meaning that
     things will be built with modules instead of one giant Perl script,
     making it easier to maintain and read, and it will enable us to make pisg
     get data, or parse data from another source than a logfile; for example
     an SQL database, *sometime*. This means that pisg is now coming with a
     new subdir 'modules/' containing all the modules pisg need.  (thanks to
     Phil Gregory) if you expierence any problems with this change, please
     report back. 
   * Moved some documentation to a new 'docs/' folder.

     stats at all)
   * Display the total count of topics that were set
   * Some small HTML validation fixes
   * Fix: pisg didn't find the alias for the kicker.
   * Stop hardcoding filenames in 'legend'
   * Removed support for unnamed arguments on commandline, everyone should now
     use the named arguments. (For example you must do 'pisg.pl -l
     logfile-name', and not just do 'pisg.pl chan logfile format maintainer')
   * Add support for 'sex' for users in pisg.cfg, this will make the stats
     always mention text with the right sex when saying for example 'she was

     instead..
   * <words foul="..."> is now known as <set words="...">
   * Add new options 'show_wpl' and 'show_cpl', this enables user to view the
     'chars per line' and 'words per line' in the 'most active nicks',
     disabled by default.
   * New option 'show_time', this will display a small bar in the 'most active
     nicks' of when the respective people actually speak. [enabled]
   * Because of the above change, there is new png files for pisg, remember to
     use the new ones and not the old ones! (thanks Christian Legler)

     releases)

   * Commandline option -c is now -ch
   * Uncompress files with *.gz and *.bz2 automatically (Sascha Lüdecke)
   * Add new feature --prefix, this works on commandline so you only get logs

     dir/#mychan* files. (Sascha Lüdecke)
   * Fix op tracking with bxlog logs
