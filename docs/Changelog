pisg (0.23)
   * Support irssi logfiles
   * Topics in mIRC format wasn't being recognized. Fixed.
   * Don't go beserk when the logfile doesn't contain any data; just tell it
     to the user.
   * More work on the object oriented goal of pisg:
      - cleanups, don't use globals in modules, define these in the object.
      - add HTMLGenerator.pm, and move all HTML generation code from pisg.pl
        to this new module.
      - New module Pisg.pm brings the rest of the main code into it's own
        module, this means that Pisg is no longer dependent of pisg.pl.

        Again, please report back if you find any trouble with any of these
        changes.

   * Ship developer docs in docs/dev/ instead of just dumping it in docs/,
     docs/ should be for end users.
   * Various updates to language templates

pisg (0.22) - Sat, Sep 15th 2001
   * pisg.cfg now supports regexs in user.cfg when 'regexp_aliases' is
     enabled. (thanks, Phil Gregory)
   * When using logdirs, files is now sorted properly, so files are read in the
     right order (thanks, Sascha Lüdecke)
   * A bunch of English grammar corrections (thanks, Phil Gregory)
   * Words like //www is now being ignored as they should.
   * Instead of 'slaps' we now have 'violence', so one can define their own
     action lines to be counted. Like '/me hits nick on the forehead',
     configured by the 'violent' variable.
   * pisg is undergoing a large change of it's code structure, meaning that
     things will be built with modules instead of one giant Perl script,
     making it easier to maintain and read, and it will enable us to make pisg
     get data, or parse data from another source than a logfile; for example
     an SQL database, *sometime*. This means that pisg is now coming with a
     new subdir 'modules/' containing all the modules pisg need.  (thanks to
     Phil Gregory) if you expierence any problems with this change, please
     report back. 
   * Moved some documentation to a new 'docs/' folder.
   * Joins wasn't working in mIRC format, fixed.
   * Support both [HH::mm::ss] and [HH::mm] in mIRC logformats.
   * Timebars was broken when using timeoffset, showing the wrong colors
     comparing with the legend.
   * Many bugs in documentation fixed, should be cleaner now.
   * Usual minor optimizations and fixes

pisg (0.21) - Mon, Aug 27th 2001

   * Added "Most referenced URLs".
   * Stop matching 'user@host blah' as a mailto link.
   * Fix a word counting bug - was counting a lot less words than in the
     previous version.
   * Supplied some extra info to the 'got kicked' stats, now it shows an
     example kick line from the stats. (Thanks to Michael Dales for 
     show_kickline-patch)
   * The same for 'most slaps', 'most slapped', 'most actions' and
     'most shouted' stats. Every option has it's own activation_variable,
     see CONFIG-README for more infos

     stats at all)
   * Display the total count of topics that were set
   * Some small HTML validation fixes
   * Fix: pisg didn't find the alias for the kicker.
   * Stop hardcoding filenames in 'legend'

     use the named arguments. (For example you must do 'pisg.pl -l
     logfile-name', and not just do 'pisg.pl chan logfile format maintainer')

     always mention text with the right sex when saying for example 'she was
     very ..'

     background picture to the page (Vetinari)
   * If pisg can't find the config file in the current directory (when running
     from crontab), then try opening the config file in which pisg.pl resides
     instead..
   * <words foul="..."> is now known as <set words="...">
   * Add new options 'show_wpl' and 'show_cpl', this enables user to view the
     'chars per line' and 'words per line' in the 'most active nicks',
     disabled by default.
   * New option 'show_time', this will display a small bar in the 'most active
     nicks' of when the respective people actually speak. [enabled]
   * Because of the above change, there is new png files for pisg, remember to
     use the new ones and not the old ones! (thanks Christian Legler)
   * Remember to distribute the 'FORMATS' file (was missed in the last two
     releases)

   * Small updates to Danish translation
   * Small bug in documentation fixed

pisg (0.18) - Mon, Aug 6th 2001

   * Added pisg.cfg support which now obsoletes user.cfg, in this file
     everything should be set, instead of in the script - this makes it easier
     upgrading pisg. Read CONFIG-README in order to "understand" it.
   * Commandline option -c is now -ch
   * Uncompress files with *.gz and *.bz2 automatically (Sascha Lüdecke)
   * Add new feature --prefix, this works on commandline so you only get logs
     starting with what you specify, for example -p '#mychan' will only get
     dir/#mychan* files. (Sascha Lüdecke)
   * Fix op tracking with bxlog logs
   * Added Foulwords-Variable to pisg.cfg
