------------------

This file contains a list of the different formats that pisg supports. It
also includes a sample line for these formats.

* mIRC:
  - A client for Windows (www.mirc.com)
  
  - If you want to create mIRC logfiles with your eggdrop, you can get some TCL
    which does it all for you (also logrotating and much more).

    MEL (mIRCStats Eggdrop Logger) can be downloaded from the following URL:

    http://mel.angelbears.org/

    Remember to timestamp your logs, or it wont work, the timestamp must be
    in [HH:MM] or [HH:MM:SS] format.
