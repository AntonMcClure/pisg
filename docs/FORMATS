FORMATS - supported logfile formats by pisg
------------------

This file contains a list of the different logfile formats which pisg
supports. It also includes a sample line for these formats.

If you don't have access to any of the clients/bots or you use some other
IRC client/bot which isn't supported, then it's fairly easy to add support
for a new IRC log format if you have some Perl knowledge, take a look at
modules/Pisg/Parser/Format/Template.pm. If you don't have any Perl
knowledge, then mail a sample logfile to the mailinglist (preferred as a
link to the logfile)

* mIRC:
  - A client for Windows (www.mirc.com)
  
  - If you want to create mIRC logfiles with your eggdrop, you can get some TCL
    which does it all for you (also logrotating and much more).

    MEL (mIRCStats Eggdrop Logger) can be downloaded from the following URL:

    http://mel.angelbears.org/

    Remember to timestamp your logs, or it wont work, the timestamp must be
    in [HH:MM] or [HH:MM:SS] format.
    
  - In order to use this, format must be set to 'mIRC'.

  Example:
        [23:44] <Christina> Hello world

* X-Chat:
  -  A client for Linux (www.xchat.org)
    
  -  In order to use this, format must be set to 'xchat'.

  Both the old logformat, and the new logformat from 1.8.7 and above is
  supported.

  Example of old logformat:
        18:01:43 <Ben> Hello world

  Example of new logformat:
        jan 13 04:39:42 <Ben> Hello World


* Eggdrop:
  - A cool and advanced IRC bot for Linux (www.eggheads.org)

  - In order to use this, format must be set to 'eggdrop'.

  You might want to change the logfile-suffix in order for pisg to parse the
  files in the correct order when using 'logdir':
  set logfile-suffix ".%Y%m%d" instead of the standard format
  set logfile-suffix ".%d%b%Y".
  

  Example:
        [00:02] <Jenny> Hello world
     
* Grufti:
  - A bot which I'm not really familiar with (www.grufti.com)
  - The author has actually made something like pisg called 'gruftistats',
    but someone mailed me and told me that it hadn't been maintained for
    over a year, and it had some problems..

        [00:17] <John> Hello world

  axur/epic logs with two formats at once, one for normal users

  - Development on the bot seems to have stopped. I did need to edit it
    a bit to get it to log actions correctly.
