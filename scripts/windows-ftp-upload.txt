AUTOMATIC FTP UPLOAD SCRIPT FOR WINDOWS
-----------------------------

Change the paths and such so they make sense with your config and have fun all
you poor m$ users. ;)  (NOTE:  You may need to change the last line to 'ftp
-s:%f0' on some old NT systems.)  Basically just put all your ftp commands
between the 'goto skip' and ':skip', and put any commands you want executed
BEFORE IT (like pisg) at the end.  The batch file will ignore the ftp stuff
because of the goto, and the ftp script will ignore the one command it doesnt
recognize(goto) with a small complaint and no error.
