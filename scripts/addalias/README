Addalias.pl
Version: 0.2
Maintainer: Winfried "Doomshammer" Neessen <doomy@doomshammer.yi.org>

Info:
--
This is a small Perl script/webinterface enabling users to add their own
aliases/pictures/links/sex to pisg.cfg

Installation:
--
Put the addalias.pl script in your cgi-bin directory, and also put your
pisg.cfg in the same directory with the right permissions.

Put addalias.htm to another location of your website, it will try to post to
/cgi-bin/addalias.pl.

Usage:
--
The user just has to fill out the form "addalias.htm" and "submit" :) First
of all the script searches the pisg.cfg if the nick already exists in the
pisg.cfg If thats not the point it adds the Aliases aso. in syntax-style of
your pisg.cfg

For the user it is possible to set "Nickname, Alias, Userpic-URL, Link (Mail
or URL), Sex and Ignore"

I think this script makes it more easier to maintain the pisg.cfg
up-to-date, because YOU haven't got to search the log for aliases and so
on... it's time to make the users work :)
