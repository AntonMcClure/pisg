This is a small Perl script/webinterface enabling users to add their own
aliases/pictures/links to users.cfg

It was made by Doomshammer <doomshammer@doomshammer.yi.org>, so any
questions/suggestions etc. should go to him.

Documentation:
--
The user just has to fill out the form "addalias.htm" and "submit" :) First of
all the script searches the users.cfg if the nick allready exists in the
users.cfg If thats not the point it adds the Aliases aso. in syntax-style of
your users.cfg

For the user it is possible to set "Nickname, Alias, Userpic-URL, Link (Mail or
URL), and Ignore"

I think this script makes it more easier to spent the users.cfg up-to-date,
because YOU haven't to search the log for aliases and so on... it's time to
make the users work :)
