README, pisg - by me and others (see CREDITS file)
------------------
pisg - Perl IRC Statistics Generator, is a Perl script which takes IRC
logfiles and makes nice looking stats of them, which can be amusing to show
for the users of your channel.

The supported logfile formats is explained in the FORMATS file included with
this distribution.

If you don't have access to any of the clients/bots or you use some other
IRC client/bot which isn't supported, then it's fairly easy to add support
for a new IRC log format. Take a look at the source code or send me an
e-mail with the logfile format.

SETTING UP PISG
---------------
It's quite simple to set up pisg. You have 2 choices:

 * Set settings from commandline (try pisg.pl --help)
 * Configure pisg from the pisg.cfg file (more flexible and configurable)

The most important here is the name of the logfile, the maintainers name,
and then the format of your logfile.

You cannot set everything up on the commandline, only the important things.

The 'pisg.cfg' file control a lot of things, you should read CONFIG-README.

NOTE: The stats will look best with a logfile which is a least a day-long.
Some stats (like smilies, exclamation marks etc) doesn't get counted before
a special amount of time.

Also, pisg supports multiple languages so you're text will be in your own
language: Look in lang.txt to see the supported languages. The language can
be changed from within the pisg.cfg file.

You're welcome to translate pisg to your own language, it's not very hard,
look in the lang.txt file!

RUNNING PISG
------------
If you have setup everything inside the script, then you just need to run
it. If you're on a Linux/Unix system, these steps should do the work:

    $ chmod +x pisg.pl
    $ ./pisg.pl

Running pisg like this will just use the settings in pisg.cfg.

If you have more than one channel, then you can also tell it to pisg on the
commandline, the syntax is explained when doing:

    $ ./pisg.pl --help

For example the following would work:

    $ ./pisg.pl -ch \#channel -l logfile.log -f mIRC -o index.html
    
Try it out.

Setting settings on commandline, will override the relevant settings in
pisg.cfg.

CONTACT INFORMATION
-------------------
If you have any problems with setting up or running this script. Then you
can either send a mail to the pisg mailing list:

http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/pisg-general

Or you can try contacting me personally via e-mail (morten@wtf.dk).

The pisg homepage is located at http://pisg.sourceforge.net/.

If you use this script, and have a permanent URL for the location of your
generated stats, I would be delighted if you would send the url to me.  Just
to see how many people uses it, and so I can link to it from my pisg page.

Have fun :)
