README, pisg - by me and others (see CREDITS file)
------------------
pisg - Perl IRC Statistics Generator, is a Perl script which takes IRC
logfiles and makes nice looking stats of them, which can be amusing to show
for the users of your channel.

The supported logfile formats is explained in the FORMATS file included with
this distribution.

If you don't have access to any of the clients/bots or you use some other
IRC client/bot which isn't supported, then it's fairly easy to add support
for a new IRC log format. Take a look at the source code or send me an
e-mail with the logfile format.

SETTING UP PISG
---------------
It's quite simple to set up pisg. You have 2 choices:

 * Set settings from commandline (try pisg.pl --help)
 * Set settings from inside the script

The most important this is the name of the logfile, the maintainers name,
and then the format of your logfile.

You cannot set everything up on the commandline, only the important things.

The 'users.cfg' file control a lot of things, like connecting nicks
together, ignoring nicks in the stats, adding user pictures etc. There is
more documentation in the users.cfg file.

NOTE: The stats will look best with a logfile which is a least a day-long.
Some stats (like smilies, exclamation marks etc) doesn't get counted before
a special amount of time.

Also, pisg supports multiple languages so you're text will be in your own
language; English, German, Danish and French is supported at the moment and
can be set with the $lang variable in the script.

You're welcome to translate pisg to your own language, it's not very hard,
look in the lang.txt file!

RUNNING PISG
------------
If you have setup everything inside the script, then you just need to run
it. If you're on a Linux/Unix system, these steps should do the work:

    $ chmod +x pisg.pl
    $ ./pisg.pl

If you have more than one channel, then you can also tell it to pisg on the
commandline, the syntax is explained when doing:

    $ ./pisg.pl --help

For example the following would work:

    $ ./pisg.pl -c \#channel -l logfile.log -f mIRC -o index.html
    
Try it out.

Setting settings on commandline, will override the relevant settings in the
script.

CONTACT INFORMATION
-------------------
If you have any problems with setting up or running this script, please
don't hesitate to contact me. I can either be via e-mail (morten@wtf.dk) or
via ICQ (6681780).

The pisg homepage is located at http://pisg.sourceforge.net/.

If you use this script, and have a permanent URL for the location of your
generated stats, I would be delighted if you would send the url to me.  Just
to see how many people uses it, and so I can link to it from my pisg page.

Have fun :)
