README for pisg.cfg - the configuration file for pisg
------------------
This file is used for two things:
 - Setting user options (for user aliases, pics, ignores and links)
 - Setting up channel(s) to be parsed.
 - Setting pisg config options (for general things with pisg)
 - Word options (for adding words that are meant to be 'foul(bad) language')
 

USER OPTIONS
------------------
User options are set with a simple SGML like syntax; remember the nick is
always required.

For example to add aliases to a nick, then you could do this:
    <user nick="Joe" alias="Joe^*">

This will add alle Joe^'s to 'Joe' in the stats.

Another thing you can do is to add a picture to a user:
    <user nick="Ben" pic="ben_holiday.jpg">

Also you can add links to URLs and e-mails:
    <user nick="Christine" link="http://www.christine.com>

    or

    <user nick="Chris" link="chris@host.com">

The last thing you can do is to ignore nicks (for example bots):
    <user nick="nameofbot" ignore="y">

You don't have to do all this in many lines, you could just as easily do:
<user nick="Joe" alias="Joe^away Joe^work" pic="joe.jpg" link="joe@joe.com">

(Here the aliases is a space seperated list of nicks, that also works! But *
as a wildcard is smarter, but also slower).

CHANNELS SETUP
------------------

For each of your channels which you want to parse through, you make
something like this:

<channel="#channel" logfile="channel.log">
 format = "mIRC"
 maintainer = "NameOfMaintainer"
</channel>

Any options in the <channel *> section will be forced, even over commandline
options... any options before </channel> can be overridden from command line

There is a lot of variables which you can set between the <channel> and
</channel> tags, these are listed in the next section.

PISG OPTIONS
------------------
If you have multiple channels, then you can set some defaults for them, for
example you can do.

<set format="mIRC">

And you won't have to worry about setting the format for every channel.

You can also combine settings into one line such as:
<set channel="#channel" logfile="/var/log/channel.log">

All the differents variables are listed below.

Other examples:
<set lang='EN' langfile='lang.txt'>
<set bgcolor="#dedeee" text="black" hbgcolor="#666699" hcolor="white" hicell="#BABADD" hicell2="#CCCCCC">
<set activenicks="25" activenicks2="30" topichistory="3" nicktracking="0" timeoffset="+0">

                     generated, then for example do +1


WORD OPTIONS
------------------
pisg has the feature of making stats of people using "foul words" or bad
language, like fuck, shit, etc. but this is something people would like to
configure to their own language and slang.

So this option configures which words which are considered to be "foul":

<words foul="ass bitch fuck">

Or in German:
<words foul="scheisse scheiße kacke">


Have fun configuring pisg! :)
