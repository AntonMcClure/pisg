README for pisg.cfg - the configuration file for pisg
------------------
This file is used for two things:
 - Setting user options (for user aliases, pics, ignores and links)
 - Setting pisg config options (for general things with pisg)
 - Word options (for adding words that are meant to be 'foul(bad) language')
 

USER OPTIONS
------------------
User options are set with a simple SGML like syntax; remember the nick is
always required.

For example to add aliases to a nick, then you could do this:
    <user nick="Joe" alias="Joe^*">

This will add alle Joe^'s to 'Joe' in the stats.

Another thing you can do is to add a picture to a user:
    <user nick="Ben" pic="ben_holiday.jpg">

Also you can add links to URLs and e-mails:
    <user nick="Christine" link="http://www.christine.com>

    or

    <user nick="Chris" link="chris@host.com">

The last thing you can do is to ignore nicks (for example bots):
    <user nick="nameofbot" ignore="y">

You don't have to do all this in many lines, you could just as easily do:
<user nick="Joe" alias="Joe^away Joe^work" pic="joe.jpg" link="joe@joe.com">

(Here the aliases is a space seperated list of nicks, that also works! But *
as a wildcard is smarter, but also slower).


PISG OPTIONS
------------------
This is a tougher part, a lot of things can be set here, simply the syntax
is like this:

<set variable="value">

For example:
<set channel="#channel">

You can also combine settings into one line such as:
<set channel="#channel" logfile="/var/log/channel.log">

A normal complete line for a channel would be:
<set channel="#channel" logfile="channel2.log" format="mIRC" network="SomeIRCNet" outputfile="index.html">

Other examples:
<set lang='EN' langfile='lang.txt'>
<set bgcolor="#dedeee" text="black" hbgcolor="#666699" hcolor="white" hicell="#BABADD" hicell2="#CCCCCC">
<set activenicks="25" activenicks2="30" topichistory="3" nicktracking="0" timeoffset="+0">


There is many variables which can be set, here's a list of them all:

                       some special directory, set the path here.

                       pisg will take that dir, and parse ALL
                       logfiles in it, and create 1 HTML file
                       from it

timeoffset             A time offset on the stats page - if your
                       country has a different timezone than the
                       machine where the stats are being
                       generated, then for example do +1


WORD OPTIONS
------------------
pisg has the feature of making stats of people using "foul words" or bad
language, like fuck, shit, etc. but this is something people would like to
configure to their own language and slang.

So this option configures which words which are considered to be "foul":

<words foul="ass bitch fuck">

Or in German:
<words foul="scheisse scheiße kacke">



Have fun configuring pisg! :)
