FORMATS - supported IRC logfile formats by pisg
------------------

pisg supports a variety of logfile formats, these are:

* mIRC:
  - A client for Windows (www.mirc.com)
  
  - If you want to create mIRC logfiles with your eggdrop, you can get some TCL
    which does it all for you (also logrotating and much more).

    MEL (mIRCStats Eggdrop Logger) can be downloaded from the following URL:

    http://mel.angelbears.org/

    Remember to timestap your logs, or it wont work, the timestamp must be
    in [HH:MM] format.
    
  - In order to use this, format must be set to 'mIRC'.

* X-Chat:
  -  A client for Linux (www.xchat.org)
    
  -  In order to use this, format must be set to 'xchat'.

  - A cool and advanced IRC bot for Linux (www.eggheads.org)

  - In order to use this, format must be set to 'eggdrop'.
     
* Grufti:
  - A bot which I'm not really familiar with (www.grufti.com)
  - The author has actually made something like pisg called 'gruftistats',
    but someone mailed me and told me that it hadn't been maintained for
    over a year, and it had some problems..

  - In order to use this, format must be set to 'grufti'

* bxlog:
  - A logging script for BitchX (console client - see scripts.bitchx.com)
   
  - In order to use this, format must be set to 'bxlog'
